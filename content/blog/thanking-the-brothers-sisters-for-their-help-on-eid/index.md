As salāmu ʿalaikum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

We would like to sincerely thank the brothers and sisters who spent time and effort to help with the ʿĪd prayer (organizing, set-up, clean-up, financing, collecting donations, etc.) as well as the sisters’ ʿĪd party the following night (organizing, donating, set-up, clean-up, food preparations/delivery, informing, etc.). Your help was much appreciated.

May Allāh (subḥānahu wa taʿalá) reward each and every one of you immensely with good, even if you only intended to help but could not due to circumstances.

Bārak Allāhu fīkum wa jazākam Allāhu khair.
