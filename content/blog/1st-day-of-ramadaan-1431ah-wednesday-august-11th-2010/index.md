[2010 Ramadan Calendar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ohlpvhy3to7B1Toc_LkdyeuFCf8jBzoz)

As-salaamu ‘alaikum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

This is to inform you that the 1st day of Ramaḍān will be on Wednesday, August 11th. That means that we will be praying ṣalātut-taraweeh the night of Tuesday, August 10th.

The iqaamah for ṣalātul-ʿishāʾ will be 5 minutes after the aḏān immediately followed by ṣalātut-taraweeh at Muṣallá As-Ṣaḥāba (2835 Dumaurier Ave., Ramsey). The iqaamah time will remain so unless further advised. Due to limited space, ʿishāʾ and taraweeh prayers will be for brothers only.

Please see attached for the Ramaḍān Calendar.

Barakallahu feekum.

HJC – 1st day of Ramadān 1431 – Wednesday 11 August 2010…

Official Decision and Announcement of the High Judiciary Council of Saudi Arabia…

Just a short time ago, Fatwá-Online was informed of the official decision and announcement of the High Judiciary Council of Saudi Arabia that since the moon of Ramadān was sighted this evening, here in Saudi Arabia, we have completed twenty nine (29) days of Shaʿbān (1431 A.H.), in accordance with the ḥadīth of the Messenger of Allāh (sal-Allāhu ʿalayhe wa sallam):

((Fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you, then complete thirty days of Shaʿbān. And break your fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you then fast thirty days)), [transmitted by al-Bukhārī and Muslim].

Subsequently, we shall be starting our Tarāwīḥ prayers tonight (Tuesday 10 August 2010) after the ʿishāʾ. prayer, in preparation for the first fast of Ramadān on Wednesday 11 August 2010, inshaa.-Allāh.
