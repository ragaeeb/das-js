As-salāmu ʿalaykum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

This is to remind you that the last lecture on this series will be on the 29th of Shaʿbān, which corresponds to Thursday, August 20th at Muṣallá As-Ṣaḥāba. The lecture will begin at 6:00pm and will continue until the Ramaḍān issues are finished.

As the topic is dealing with Ramaḍān, this lecture will take precedence over any other lecture held by Dār As-Ṣaḥāba on this day (i.e. other lectures will be cancelled).

Furthermore, if it is found that the 1st of Ramaḍān is on Friday, then tarawīḥ prayers will begin Thursday night and due to limited space at the muṣallá, the ʿishāʾ and tarawīḥ prayers will be for brothers only.

Please pass on this message.

Jazākumullahu khair
