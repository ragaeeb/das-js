As salāmu ʿalaikum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

To whomever this applies to, we ask that the brothers please keep the maktabah (As-Ṣaḥāba Library) clean after use. Please realize that this is not our own residence where we can leave fooḏdrinks/plates/cups, books lying around and not back on the shelves, etc. without cleaning up after ourselves. It is only from good manners that if we make a mess, we should clean it up ourselves and not leave it behind for others to do so. And realize that the sisters have a time alotted for them on Sunday, so it is essential to have the maktabah clean on Saturday night. Please take this advice as it seems to be frequent from ourselves and truly unfortunate that we have to be told.

BarakAllāhu fīkum wa jazākam Allāhu khair.
