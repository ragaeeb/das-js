As-salaamu 'alaikum wa Rahmatullaahi wa Barakaatuh,

This is to inform you that there will be a weekly Qur'an Tajweed/Memorization class held every Sunday after fajr prayer at Musalla As-Sahaba, in-sha-Allah. The class will be taught by our brother Nacim and is for brothers only.

We ask that you come and benefit. Baarakallahu feekum wa Jazaakumullaahu khayr.
