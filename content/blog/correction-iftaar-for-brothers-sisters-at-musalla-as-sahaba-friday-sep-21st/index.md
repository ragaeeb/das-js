As salāmu ʿalaikum

CORRECTION:

the Ifṭār tommorrow (Friday, Sep. 21st) at Muṣallá As-Ṣaḥāba will be for brothers and sisters.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Dār As-Ṣaḥāba Admin

As salāmu ʿalaikum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh

You are invited to break your fast at Muṣallá As-Ṣaḥāba this Friday, Sep. 21st. Maġrib is at approximately 7:04pm on Friday and please note that this ifṭār will be for brothers only due to the limited space available. Food will be free, compliments of Dār As-Ṣaḥāba so please join us.

For those who would like to earn the reward on this blessed month and help set-up, clean-up & serve food for the ifṭār, there will be a meeting on Thursday, Sep. 20th after ʿAṣr prayer (aḏān at 4:21pm) at Muṣallá As-Ṣaḥāba. Your help would be greatly appreciated.

Jazākam Allāhu Khair.
