As-salāmu ʿalaykum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

This is to inform you that the 1st day of Ramaḍān will be on Saturday, August 22nd. That means that we will be praying ṣalātut-tarawīḥ the night of Friday, August 21st.

The iqāmah for ṣalātul-ʿishāʾ will be at 9:45pm immediately followed by ṣalātut-tarawīḥ at Muṣallá As-Ṣaḥāba (2835 Dumaurier Ave., Ramsey). The iqāmah time will remain so for the first half of Ramaḍān, until further advised. Due to limited space, ʿishāʾ and tarawīḥ prayers will be for brothers only.

Bārak Allāhu fīkum.
