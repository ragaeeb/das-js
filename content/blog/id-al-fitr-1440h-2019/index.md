As-salāmu ʿalaykum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

We will be praying the ʿĪd al-Fiṭr prayer on June 4th or June 5th, 2019 at:

Ruth Wildgens Park (outside)

(1099 Grenon Avenue, behind Boys & Girls Club)

ONLY 1 Jamāʿah – 9:00 am SHARP!!!

In case of rain, we will be praying inside at:

Boys & Girls Club of Ottawa

(2825 Dumaurier Avenue)

Please bring your own rugs, blankets, umbrellas, etc.

PLEASE READ THE IMPORTANT POINTS BELOW:

PRAYER/KHUṬBAH:

PLEASE LISTEN TO THE KHUṬBAH AND REMAIN SILENT. For a number of years we’ve been having problems with people talking after the prayer during the ʿĪd khuṭbah. Should you decide to stay while the khaṭīb is speaking, then you must show some respect for the Islāmic knowledge, the khaṭīb and those who wish to listen to the khuṭbah by remaining silent. You may greet one another either outside of the prayer hall/area, or after the khuṭbah is completely finished. We also ask the sisters to be mindful about this and we ask the brothers who bring their families to please advise them in this.

Jazākumullāhu khairan wa bārakallāhu fīkum.
