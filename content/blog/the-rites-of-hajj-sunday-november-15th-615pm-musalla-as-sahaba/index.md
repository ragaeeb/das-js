As-salāmu ʿalaykum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

This Sunday, November 15th, at the same time and place as the class on Imām An-Nawawīʿs 40 aḥadīth class, Shaykh Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān will hold a special session on the Rites of Ḥajj. This will focus on the fiqh of ḥajj and is for everyone who is planning on making ḥajj in the future, in-shāʾ-Allāh. The 40 aḥadīth class will resume next Sunday bi-idhnillah.

This class is free for both brothers and sisters and we encourage you to benefit from this blessed knowledge and attend.
