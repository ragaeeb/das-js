Due to the new stronger COVID-19 Provincewide (Stay-at-home Order) Shutdown restrictions, as a precautionary measure, we have decided to keep the Muṣallá CLOSED until further notice.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">**Effective Monday, April 19th, 2021, there will be NO PRAYERS at Muṣallá As-Sahaba**</span> for the public until further notice. <span style="text-decoration: underline">**This includes the daily prayers, al-Jumu'ah and at-Taraweeh prayers.**</span> We appreciate your understanding during these times.

We ask that you pray in your homes, stay safe and please continue to follow COVID-19 health measures set by the Province of Ontario and Ottawa Public Health.
