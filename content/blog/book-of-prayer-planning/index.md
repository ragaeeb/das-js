As-salāmu ʿalaikum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

Dārul-Ḥadīth is planning to start up another fiqh intensive course in the near future on The Book of Prayer. This will be taught by Shaykh Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Mohamed ‘Alī (a graduate from the Islāmic University of Madīnah) and the format of this course will be similar to the previous one (The Book of Purification) which recently finished a while ago. There will be a small cost for the course, and it will be held once a week (on the weekend), approximately 2.5 – 3 hours per class, in-sha-Allāh taʿalá.

To get an idea of how many people are interested in taking the course, please send an email to darulḥadīths@gmail.com mentioning your desire to enroll. A future email will be sent to you (by Dārul-Ḥadīth) once the course details have been finalized, bi-idhnillahi taʿalá. Also please check http://darulhadiths.googlepages.com/home in the near future for updates.

Please pass on this message to whomever you feel may be interested

Barākallahu fīkum.
