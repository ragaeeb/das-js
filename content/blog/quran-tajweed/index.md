As-salāmu ʿalaikum wa Raḥmatullahi wa barakātuh,

This is to inform you that every Tuesday between ṣalāhul-maġrib and ṣalāhul-‘Ishā, there will be Qurʾān tajwīd lessons for brothers only at Muṣallá as-Ṣaḥāba (2835 Dumaurier Ave., Ramsey). the lessons will be given by brother Maḥmūd Muḥammad as-Sumālī and everybody can go at their own pace in memorizing the Book of Allāh ﷺ.

All of the brothers are encouraged to come and benefit, in-sha’Allāh, so please don’t pass up this opportunity.

Bārak Allāhu fīkum.
