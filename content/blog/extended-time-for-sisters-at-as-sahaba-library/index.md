As salāmu ʿalaikum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh

This is to officially inform you that the `sisters’` time at As-Ṣaḥāba Library (254 Carleton Avenue) has been extended to include Tuesdays and Thursdays from the daytime (unspecified) until 8:00pm for the summer months (until further notice, in-sha’Allāh). please remember that this time is for `sisters` only in addition to the time they currently have (Sundays from 1:00pm to 6:00pm) and we ask the brothers to respect this and not enter the library during these times. Jazākam allāhu khair.

Please pass on this message to your female relatives who may be interested. barakAllāhu fīkum.
