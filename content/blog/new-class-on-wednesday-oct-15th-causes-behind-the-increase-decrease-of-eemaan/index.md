As salāmu ʿalaikum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

There will be a new class beginning this Wednesday, Oct. 15th, between maġrib and ʿishāʾ prayers at Muṣallá as-Ṣaḥāba and telelinked to As-Ṣaḥāba Library. The book being covered is the Causes Behind the Increase & Decrease of Īmān by Shaykh ʿAbd al-Razzāq al-‘Abbaad which will be taught by our brother Abū ʿAbd al-Wāḥid Nādir Aḥmad as-Sudānī.

The iqaamah for ṣalātul-maġrib is 5 minutes after the aḏān at the muṣallá.

This class is free for both brothers and sisters and we encourage you to benefit from this blessed knowledge and attend.

Please pass on this message.

Jazākam Allāhu khair.
