As-salaamu 'alaikum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

This is to inform you that the 1st day of Ramaḍān will be Thursday, June 18th, 2015, in-sha-Allāh. This means that we will start praying ṣalātut-taraweeh the night of Wednesday, June 17th, in-sha-Allāh.

Since the moon of Ramaḍān was not sighted, we shall be completing thirty (30) days of Shaʿbān, in accordance with the ḥadīth of the Messenger of Allāh (sallAllāhu 'alaihi wa sallam):

(Fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you, then complete thirty days of Shaʿbān. And break your fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you then fast thirty days),

[transmitted by al-Bukhārī and Muslim].

The following are the iqaamah times at Muṣallá As-Ṣaḥāba (2835 Dumaurier Ave., Ramsey area):

Al-Fajr Prayer – 20 min. after the aḏān
Adh-Dhuhr Prayer – 1:30pm
Al-ʿAṣr Prayer – 20 min. after the aḏān
Al-Maġrib Prayer – 10 min. after the aḏān
Al-ʿishāʾ Prayer & At-Tarawīḥ Prayers – 5 minutes after the aḏān
Al-jumuʿah Prayer – 1:00pm

The iqaamah times will remain so unless further advised. Due to limited space, 'jumu'ah, ʿishāʾ and taraweeh prayers will be for brothers only.

Barakallahu feekum.
