As-salaamu 'alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakaatuh,

This is to inform you that the 1st day of Ramadaan will be Thursday, June 18th, 2015, in-sha-Allah. This means that we will start praying salaatut-taraweeh the night of Wednesday, June 17th, in-sha-Allah.

Since the moon of Ramadaan was not sighted, we shall be completing thirty (30) days of Sha'baan, in accordance with the hadeeth of the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu 'alaihi wa sallam):

(Fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you, then complete thirty days of Sha'baan. And break your fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you then fast thirty days),

[transmitted by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim].

The following are the iqaamah times at Musalla As-Sahaba (2835 Dumaurier Ave., Ramsey area):

Al-Fajr Prayer – 20 min. after the adhaan
Adh-Dhuhr Prayer – 1:30pm
Al-‘Asr Prayer – 20 min. after the adhaan
Al-Maghrib Prayer – 10 min. after the adhaan
Al-‘Ishaa Prayer & At-Taraweeh Prayers – 5 minutes after the adhaan
Al-Jumu’ah Prayer – 1:00pm

The iqaamah times will remain so unless further advised. Due to limited space, 'jumu'ah, 'ishaa and taraweeh prayers will be for brothers only.

Barakallahu feekum.
