As salāmu ʿalaikum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

This is to inform you that the classes held this weekend with Shaykh Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān are tentative depending on the health of the shaykh. There is a slight probability that they may be cancelled due to him not feeling well, so please be aware of that. This includes the Saturday class at the Carleton University as well as the Sunday class at Muṣallá as-sahaba.

We will try to get information to you as best as we can, and we apologize beforehand for any last minute cancellations.

Please pass on this message.

Bārak Allāhu fīkum
