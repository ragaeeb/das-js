As salāmu ʿalaikum,

This is to inform you of the change in time for Abū Mu’tasim’s telelink on Friday nights. The new time will be before maġrib at 7:30pm SHARP, on Fridays starting tonight (May 9th, 2008).

Rescuing the Needy from the Traps of Shayṭān – book by Ibn al-Qayyim
Fridays @ Muṣallá As-Ṣaḥāba & As-Ṣaḥāba Library
(3-WAY TELELINK)
– 7:30pm SHARP!!!
– for both brothers and sisters

Also, a new Qurʾān class will begin at As-Ṣaḥāba Library on Saturdays after ṣalāt al-Dhuhr for brothers only. Br. Maḥmūd As-Sumālī will be teaching it, in-sha’Allāh.

We encourage you to benefit from these classes.

BarakAllāhu fīkum.
