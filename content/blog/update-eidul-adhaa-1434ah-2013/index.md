As-salaamu 'alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakaatuh,

'Eidul-Adhaa will be on Tuesday, October, 15th, 2013.

In-sha-Allah, we will be praying the 'Eidul-Adhaa prayer at the

Ruth Wildgens Park (outside)

ONLY 1 jama'ah - 8:30 am SHARP!!!

Please bring your own rugs, blankets, etc.

PLEASE READ THE IMPORTANT POINTS BELOW:

PARKING:

Parking will be available at the following locations:

1. Boys & Girls Club
2. Abraar School
3. Church parking lot
4. On Dumaurier and Grenon Avenue (the other side of Abraar School).

Please mind the parking. There will be parking attendants guiding the vehicles at the designated parking lots. We ask you to pay attention to them, follow their instructions and please park as well as leave in an organized manner before and after the 'Eid prayer/khutbah.

PRAYER/KHUTBAH:

PLEASE LISTEN TO THE KHUTBAH AND REMAIN SILENT. For a number of years we've been having problems with people talking after the prayer during the 'Eid khutbah. Should you decide to stay while the khateeb is speaking, then you must show some respect for the Islamic knowledge, the khateeb and those who wish to listen to the khutbah by remaining silent. You may greet one another either outside of the prayer hall, or after the khutbah is completely finished. We ask the sisters to be mindful about this and we ask the brothers who bring their families to please advise them in this.

Jazaakumullahu khairan wa baarakallahu feekum.
