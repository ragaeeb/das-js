As-salāmu ʿalaykum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

This is to inform you about the current status of the “Book of Prayer” Intensive course, which will be given by Shaykh Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān, in-shāʾ-Allāh. This course was scheduled to begin soon and thus you may be wondering what happened and why it hasn’t commenced as of yet. But just to let you know, Darul-Ḥadīth is still intending to have this course, however, it seemed that due to the current OC Transpo Bus strike, it would be in the best interest for everyone if this course were to start after the strike was over (whenever that may be). This would make it easier for the students (especially without vehicles) to attend the course on a regular basis. We will keep you informed of any updates, in-shāʾ-Allāh.

Please pass on this message to whomever it may concern.

Bārak Allāhu fīkum.
