Due to the new COVID-19 Provincewide Shutdown measures, we have decided to keep the Muṣallá CLOSED until further notice as a precaution.

**Beginning Saturday, December 26th, 2020, there will be NO JUMU’AH and NO DAILY PRAYERS at Muṣallá As-Sahaba** until further notice. We appreciate your understanding during these times.

We ask that you pray in your homes, stay safe and please continue to follow COVID-19 health measures set by the Province of Ontario and Ottawa Public Health.

For more information regarding COVID-19 guidelines and restrictions within the City of Ottawa, visit https://ottawa.ca/en/health-and-public-safety/covid-19-ottawa

We will continue to monitor the situation for Ottawa and plan to reopen based on the Province of Ontario and the City of Ottawa's guidelines. Please keep checking our website https://dar-as-sahaba.com for the latest updates.

Jazakumullahu Khayran for your cooperation and understanding.
