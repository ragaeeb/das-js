As-salāmu ʿalaykum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

Bismillahi walḥamdulillāh was-ṣalātu was-salāmu 'alaa Rasūlillāh

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 restrictions imposed by the city and maximum capacity restrictions, we will be back to a single Jumʿuah prayer with the khuṭbah: starting at `1:00 PM`. We will however be extending space at the back of the muṣallá for others who could not make it early on before the capacity was filled.
