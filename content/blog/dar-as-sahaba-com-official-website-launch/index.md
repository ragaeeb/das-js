As-salāmu ʿalaykum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

Bismillah, walḥamdulillāh was-ṣalātu was-salāmu ‘alaa rasūlillāh,

This is to inform you of the official launch of Dār As-Ṣaḥāba Association’s new website https://dar-as-sahaba.com. Please bookmark it. In-sha-Allāh, we will be using this website for our lecture and event updates from now on instead of our google-groups site. Our other website, islamcanada.com is under construction. In das.ilmtest.net you will also find some beneficial articles and in the near future, we hope to post some audio lectures for you to benefit.

You will find the following on the home page:

1. In the Top Menu bar, you will find links related to Dār As-Ṣaḥāba as an organization

2. In the Main Menu, you will find the latest new/updates, lectures and events organized by us. There is also a search function above the main menu.

3. In the Resources Menu, you will find Islāmic articles (and audio in the future) from different scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah

4. The box on the right contain the latest updates to the site, as well as a calendar with the latest events/activities.

5. Please be patient with us, but In the near future we will have a Paypal Donation link for you to donate to the Muṣallá and Library as well as for various da’wah activities.

6. People can also directly subscribe to the current mailing list through the online subscriber.

We hope that you will benefit from the website.

Bārak Allāhu fīkum wa Jazākumullahu khair
