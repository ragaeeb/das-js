ʿĪd-ul-fiṭr is on Thursday, May 13th, 2021.

Due to the current restrictions, we will not be holding the ʿĪd ul-fiṭr Prayer in congregation this year. Please pray at home.

Jazākam Allahu Khayran for your cooperation and understanding.

Please see the image that has the instructions for how to pray ṣalāh-ul-ʿĪd at home:

May Allah grant all of us a blessed and safe ʿĪd.
