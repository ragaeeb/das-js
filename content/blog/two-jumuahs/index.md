As-salāmu ʿalaykum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

Bismillahi walḥamdulillāh was-ṣalātu was-salāmu 'alaa Rasūlillāh

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 restrictions imposed by the city and maximum capacity restrictions, we will be temporarily having two Jumʿuah prayer sessions:

- 1st Khuṭbah: ʿ1:00 PMʿ
- 2nd Khuṭbah: ʿ1:45 PMʿ
