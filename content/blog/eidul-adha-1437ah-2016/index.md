As-salāmu ʿalaykum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

ʿīd-ul-Adḥá is on Monday, September 12th, 2016, in-shāʾ-Allāh.

We will be praying the ʿīdul-Adḥá prayer at:

Ruth Wildgens Park (outside)

(1099 Grenon Avenue, behind Boys & Girls Club)

ONLY 1 jamāʿah - 8:00 am SHARP!!!

In case of rain, we will be praying inside at:

Boys & Girls Club of Ottawa

(2825 Dumaurier Avenue)

1st jamāʿah - 8:00 am SHARP!!!

2nd jamāʿah - 9:00 am SHARP!!!

Please bring your own rugs, blankets, umbrellas, etc.

PLEASE READ THE IMPORTANT POINTS BELOW:

PARKING:

Parking will be available at the following locations:
On Dumaurier and Grenon Avenue (the other side of Abraar School).

Please mind the parking. There will be parking attendants guiding the vehicles at the designated parking lots. We ask you to pay attention to them, follow their instructions and please park as well as leave in an organized manner before and after the ʿīd prayer/Khuṭbah.

PRAYER/KHUṬBAH:

PLEASE LISTEN TO THE KHUṬBAH AND REMAIN SILENT. For a number of years we've been having problems with people talking after the prayer during the ʿīd Khuṭbah. Should you decide to stay while the khaṭīb is speaking, then you must show some respect for the Islāmic knowledge, the khaṭīb and those who wish to listen to the Khuṭbah by remaining silent. You may greet one another either outside of the prayer hall/area, or after the Khuṭbah is completely finished. We also ask the sisters to be mindful about this and we ask the brothers who bring their families to please advise them in this.

Jazākumullahu khairan wa bārak Allāhu fīkum.
