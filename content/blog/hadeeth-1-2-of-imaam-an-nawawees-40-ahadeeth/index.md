As salāmu ʿalaikum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

[Attached is a pdf document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X3w38YczSc1IAkOmZZI5-OJ1PEKUND56) containing the 1st two aḥadīth from Imām an-Nawawī’s 40 Aḥadīth. This contains only the text (arabic & english) of the aḥadīth for memorization. Please print this and bring it with you to the class. Don’t forget your notebook to take notes on the explanation. If you can have the 1st ḥadīth memorized for the Sunday class, then that would be even better.

May Allāh facilitate this and make this knowledge easy for us to memorize, understand and apply it in our daily lives.

Jazākam Allāhu khair
