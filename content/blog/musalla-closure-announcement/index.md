As-salaamu 'alaikum wa Rahmatullaahi wa Barakaatuh,

This is to inform you that the last day of operations for Musalla As-Sahaba was May 31st, 2022. Commencing June 1st, 2022, Dar As-Sahaba Association is not responsible for any activity at that location. Consequently, we stopped collecting donations for the musalla since the closure was announced in March 2022.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has supported and/or contributed to this musalla in anyway whether financially, physically or otherwise. May Allah count it on your scale of good deeds on the Day of Judgment.

Jazaakumullaahu khayran wa BaarakAllahu feekum
