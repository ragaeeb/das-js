As salāmu ʿalaikum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

We apologize for the last minute notice, but there will be a telelink with one of the scholars this Sunday, September 30th, at around 2:00pm (after ṣalātudh-dhuhr which is at 1:30pm) at Muṣallá As-Ṣaḥāba (for brothers & sisters), with a 3-way call to Maktabah As-Ṣaḥāba (for sisters only), insha’Allāh. the telelink should hopefully begin at 2:00pm but please be prepared for a slight delay.

We hope that you can attend.
