“Indeed Allāh will help those who help Him. Indeed Allāh is Exalted in Might, All-Powerful.” [Sūrah Ḥajj 22:40]

Imām ash-Shinqīṭī (d.1393H) – raḥimahullāh – said:

“Allāh – the Mighty and Majestic – explains in this noble Aayah that He has sworn to help and give victory to those who help Him. It is known that the help and victory of Allāh comes by following what He has prescribed, obeying His commend, avoiding His prohibitions, by helping His Messengers and their followers, aiding His Religion and fighting against His enemies and overpowering them – until the word of Allāh is made uppermost, whilst the word of His enemies is debased and mode low. Then Allāh – the Most High, the Most Magnificent – explains the charecteristics of those whom He has promised would receive His help and victory, distinguishing them from others. So He said – explaining those to whom He swore He would aid and give victory to – because He is the one to aid and give victory:

“Those who, if We establish them in the earth, establish the prayer, give the Zakāt, enjoin the good and forbid the evil.” [Sūrah Ḥajj 22:41].

And that which this noble āyah indicates is that whosoever aids Allāh, then Allāh will aid Him. This is clearly explained in other than this place, such as His – the Most High’s – sayings.

“O you who Believe. If you help Allāh, Allāh will help you; and establish your feet firmly. But those who disbelieve, for them is destruction and Allāh will make their deeds vain.” [Sūrah Muḥammad 47:7].

“Indeed, Our Word has gone forth of old for our slaves, the Messengers, that they will certainly be victorious; and that Our forces will certainly be triumphant.” [Sūrah as-Saafaat 37:171-173].

“Allāh has Decreed: It is My Messenger and I who will prevail.” [Sūrah Mujaadalah 58:21].

“Allāh has promised to those amongst you who believe and do righteous actions that He will grant you the khilaafah in the land.” [Sūrah an-Nūr 24:55].

And in His – the Most High’s – saying:

“Those who, if We establish them in the earth, establish the prayer, give the Zakāt, enjoin the good and forbid the evil.” [Sūrah Ḥajj 22:41].

In it is a proof that there is no promise from Allāh of His help, except by establishing the Prayer, paying the Zakāh, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. So it is these whom Allāh will establish upon the earth and will strengthen His Word through them. However, those who do not establish the ṣalāh, nor pay the Zakāh, nor enjoin the good nor forbid the evil, then there is no promise for them from Allāh that He will aid and grant them victory. They are not from His party, nor are they his friends -those who have the promise of His help and victory. Rather, they are the party of Shayṭān and his friends. So if they were to expect the help of Allāh and the fulfillment of His promise upon them, then their example is like that of a hired worker who refuses to do the labour that he was hired for, yet he expects to be rewarded. So whosoever is like this, then he has no intellect!”[1]
