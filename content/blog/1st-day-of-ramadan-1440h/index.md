As-salāmu ʿalaikum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

As the crescent of Ramaḍān has been sighted, this is to inform you that the 1st day of Ramaḍān will be Monday, May 6th, 2019, in-sha’-Allāh. This means that we will start praying Ṣalāh al-Tarawīḥ tonight (the night of Sunday, May 5th, 2019, in-sha’-Allāh.

(Fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you, then complete thirty days of Shaʿbān. And break your fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you then fast thirty days).
