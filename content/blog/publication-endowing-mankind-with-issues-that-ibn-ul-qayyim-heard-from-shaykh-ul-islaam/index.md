Who is Abū ‘Abdur Raḥmān Muḥammad ʿAjjāl?

ash Shaykh al-ʿAllāmah Ṣāliḥ b. Saʿd as Suḥaymī.

All praise is due to Allāh and may the Salaat and Salām be upon the Messenger of Allāh.
To proceed:

Indeed the brother, the Shaykh, Muḥammad ‘Alee ‘Ajaal, who graduated from the faculty of Hadeeth in the Islāmic University of Madeenah, is one of the students of knowledge who are known to me for steadfastness, good mannerisms, sound methodology and keen upon seeking knowledge. He has exerted good efforts in calling to Allāh the Elevated, upon the methodology of the Salaf as Saaleh.
One should be keen upon sitting and benefiting from the likes of him by the permission of Allah.

Likewise I believe him to be so, and Allah is the One Who holds him to account, and I do not praise anyone over Allāh.
May Allāh grant all success to what He loves and is pleased with, and may the Salaat and Salām be upon the Messenger of Allāh, his family and companions.

Dr. Ṣāliḥ b. Saʿd as Suḥaymī
Lecturer at the Islāmic University of Madeenah.
Teacher at the Prophetic Masjid of Madeenah.
