By Shaykh Abū Anas Hamadal-ʿUthaymān [1]

Allāh – the Most Perfect, Most High – said:

“O you who Believe! Have taqwáa (fear) of Allāh and believe in His Messenger; and He will bestow upon you a double portion of His Mercy and He will provide you with a light by which you will walk.” [2]

Allāh – the Most High – also said:

“O you who Believe! If you have taqwáa of Allāh, He will give to you a Furqān (criterion to judge between right and wrong).” [3]

Al-Ḥāfidh Ibn Kathīr (d.777H) – raḥimahullāh – said: “Ibn ʿAbbās, as-Suddee, ‘Ikrimah, ad-Ḍaḥḥāk, Qatādah and Muqātil b. Ḥayyān all said about “Furqān” that it means: a way out (from difficulty). Mujāhid added: A way out (from difficulty) both in this world and in the Hereafter. In a narration from Ibn ʿAbbās he said it means: salvation; and in another narration from him: being helped. Muḥammad b. ʿIshāʾaq said that it means: a criterion to judge between truth and falsehood. This explanation from Ibn ʿIshāʾaq is the most general of what has already preceded and it is a necessary consequence of it. Since whoever has taqwáa of Allāh by obeying His command and abandoning what He has prohibited, will be given the ability to recognize truth from falsehood. This will be the cause for his salvation, his being helped; and the cause for his worldly affairs being made easier and his happiness on the Day of Judgement. It will also be the cause for his sins to be expiated by Allāh shielding him from the people. It will likewise be the cause of him being the recipient of a great reward from Allāh, as He – the Most High – says:

“O you who Believe! Have taqwáa (fear) of Allāh and believe in His Messenger; and He will bestow upon you a double portion of His Mercy and He will provide you with a light by which you will walk.” [4], [5]

Ibn Masʿūd – radi Allāhu ‘anhu – said: “Indeed I hold that a person forgets knowledge that he used to know because of sins that he commits.” [6]

Wakī’ (d.197H) – raḥimahullāh – said: “I seek help in memorization by abandoning sin and disobedience.” [7]

Mālik (d.179H) said to al-Shāfiʿī when they first met: Indeed I see that Allāh has placed a light upon your heart, so do not extinguish it with the darkness of disobedience and sin.” [8]

Imām al-Shāfiʿī (d.204H) – raḥimahullāh – said: “Whosoever loves that Allāh should open up his heart for him and grant light to him, then let him abandon speech about that which does not concern him, and abandon sins and turn away from acts of disobedience. Then there will be between him and Allāh a hidden treasure of good actions. So if this is done, then Allāh will open up such knowledge for him that will pre-occupy him. And indeed in death is the greatest pre-occupation.” [9]

Shaykh al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) said: “Allāh – the Most Perfect – has made as a punishment for people’s sins, the absence of guidance and beneficial knowledge, as He says:

“They say: Our hearts are wrapped-up (and we do not understand). Rather, Allāh has put a seal upon their hearts because of their disbelief.” [10]

And He said:

“They say: Our hearts are wrapped-up (and we do not understand). Rather, Allāh has cursed them for their disbelief.” [11]

And He said:

“And we shall turn their hearts and their sight away from guidance, as they refused to believe therein for the first time.” [12]

And Allāh says:

“In their hearts is a disease, and Allāh increases their disease.” [13]

And He says:

“So when they turned away, Allāh turned their hearts away.” [14], [15]
