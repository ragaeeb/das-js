As-salāmu ʿalaykum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

This is to inform you that the 1st day of Ramaḍān will be Sunday, June 29th, 2014, in shā’ Allāh. This means that we will start praying ṣalātut-tarāwīḥ the night of Saturday, June 28th, in shā’ Allāh.

Since the moon of Ramaḍān was not sighted, we shall be completing thirty (30) days of Shaʿbān (1435 AH), in accordance with the ḥadīth of the Messenger of Allāh (sallAllāhu ʾalaihi wa sallam):

(Fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you, then complete thirty days of Shaʿbān. And break your fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you then fast thirty days),

[transmitted by al-Bukhārī and Muslim].

The following are the iqāmah times at Muṣallá As-Ṣaḥāba (2835 Dumaurier Ave., Ramsey area):

AL-FAJR PRAYER – 20 MIN. AFTER THE ADHAAN
ADH-DHUHR PRAYER – 1:30PM
AL-ʿAṢR PRAYER – 20 MIN. AFTER THE ADHAAN
AL-MAĠRIB PRAYER – 10 MIN. AFTER THE ADHAAN
AL-ʿISHĀʾA PRAYER & AT-TARĀWĪḤ PRAYERS – 5 MINUTES AFTER THE ADHAAN
AL-JUMUʾAH PRAYER – 1:00PM
The iqāmah times will remain so unless further advised. Due to limited space, jumu’ah, ʿishāʾ and tarāwīḥ prayers will be for brothers only.

Please see the attached 1435 AH / 2014 Ramaḍān Calendar.

Bārak Allāhu fīkum.
