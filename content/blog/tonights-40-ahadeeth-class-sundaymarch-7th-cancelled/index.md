As-salāmu ʿalaykum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

This is to inform you that tonight’s 40 Aḥadīth class (Sunday, March 7th) is CANCELLED. Shaykh Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān’s uncle passed away this morning. May Allāh forgive him, have mercy upon him and grant him jannatul-firdaws.

Class will resume next Sunday in-shāʾ-Allāh, unless further advised.

Please pass on this message. Jazākumullahu khair.
