Al-Ḥamdu-Lillāhi Rabbil-ʿĀlamīn, was-Ṣalātu was-Salāmu ʿalá Ashrafil-Anbiyā e wal-Mursalīn. Wa baʿd:

Dear Fellow Students:

As-Salamu’alaykum wa Raḥmatullaahi wa Barakatuhu.

All praise is due to Allāh (Subḥānahu Wa Taʿalá), The taʿalá, Who allowed us to successfully organize and participate in the Book of Purification intensive course. May Allāh, The Most High, make this course a source of benefit for all of us. Amīn.

We would like to begin by thanking those students and guests who attended the first lecture this past Saturday. May Allāh (SWT) accept your good deeds and reward you for your efforts to attain beneficial religious knowledge. We would also like to thank our teacher, Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān, for sharing his knowledge through the preparation and teaching of this important course.

Class Attendance / Participation

Please note that the Book of Purification course is for registered students only and, when applicable, their guests. Each registered student is allowed to bring one (1) guest until the third course lecture (July 12th, 2008). The student must register the guest’s name on the weekly attendance sheets. After July 12th, guests will be given the option to register for the class.

We kindly ask those brothers and sisters who have children to make child care arrangements for the duration of the class, as the presence of children may distract the instructor anḏor class participants and is thus not permitted. May Allāh (SWT) reward you for your effort in this regard.

Class Etiquette

Please remember that eating and drinking is not permitted during the class. Breaks of five or ten minutes will be given during each class.

Please also remember to respect the knowledge of the instructor by avoiding any actions that may distract the instructor or class participants.

Payment of Course Fee

The cost of attending the Book of Purification course is \$120 per student. If you have not already paid, please do so promptly. If you cannot pay the entire fee in one installment, then please send an e-mail to: darulḥadīths@gmail.com in order to arrange a flexible payment schedule.

May Allāh (Subḥānahu Wa Taʿalá) increase us in knowledge and reward our striving in this world and in the hereafter. Amīn.

Jazāk Allāhu khairan,
