Alḥamdulillāh, as the COVID-19 Provincewide restrictions have eased in Ottawa, <span style="underline">**effective March 1st, 2022**</span>, Musalla As-Ṣaḥāba will open for all daily prayers at <span style="underline">**full capacity**</span> indoors <span style="underline">**with mandatory masks**</span>. This includes the 5 daily prayers and the jumu’ah prayer.

We will resort back to <span style="underline">**one (1) khutbah for Al-Jumu’ah prayer @ 12:30pm (for brothers only)**</span>.

The remaining prayer timings can be found on our website.

We will continue to monitor the situation for Ottawa and adjust based on the Province of Ontario and the City of Ottawa’s guidelines. Please keep checking our website https://dar-as-sahaba.com for any updates.
