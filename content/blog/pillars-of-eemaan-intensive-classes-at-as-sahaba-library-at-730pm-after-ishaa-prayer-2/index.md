As-salāmu ʿalaykum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

Since the iqāmah for the ʿishāʾ prayer at the main masjid on Scott St. has moved to 7:30pm, we will pray at the masjid first and then walk to the library to begin the class. The class should begin approximately between 7:45 and 8:00pm, in-shāʾ-Allāh.

We will also try our best to have a Paltalk room open for the class, in-shāʾ-Allāh so the people who cannot make it to the class can benefit from home, bi-idhnillah taʿalá. So please excuse us if we cannot manage. The room will be under the group Religion & Spirituality > Islām > Dār As Ṣaḥāba Pillars of Īmān at beginning at approxmately `7:45pm EST`.

Bārak Allāhu fīkum.
