Effective Saturday, April 3, 2021, Ontario will be implementing the new COVID-19 Provincewide Shutdown measures (Provincewide Emergency Brake). As-Ṣaḥāba Muṣallá will still remain open, however, will be limiting capacity to 15% occupancy of the room (with masks and social distancing measures). That means, a maximum of 15 people will be permitted in the Muṣallá for all prayers (the 5 daily prayers and the jumu'ah prayers).

Also, there will be two (2) jumu'ah prayers beginning Friday, April 9th, 2021.
First Khutbah: 1:00pm
Second Khutbah: 1:45pm
