As salāmu ʿalaikum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

Due to the end of daylight savings time this Sunday, November 2, 2008, there will be a change to the schedule of Shaykh Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān’s 40 Aḥadīth class. Also, to make it easier for people who travel by bus, we have decided to schedule the class at 6:00pm (before ʿishāʾ prayer), in-sha-Allāh.

Please read below:

Time:

- Explanation of ḥadīth (brothers & sisters) – 6:00pm

- Sisters’ revision & memorization (sisters only) – 5:30pm- a sister will be present at the Muṣallá to check the memorized ḥadīth (this session is not telelinked to the Library)

Please note that the iqaamah for ʿishāʾ prayer at As-Ṣaḥāba Muṣallá will be 7:30pm until March, in-sha-Allāh.

This class is free for both brothers and sisters and we encourage you to benefit from this blessed knowledge and attend.

Jazākam Allāhu khair.
