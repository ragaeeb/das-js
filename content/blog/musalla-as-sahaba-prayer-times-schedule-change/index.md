As-salāmu ʿalaykum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

Due to the change in the daylight savings time (tomorrow morning), the prayer times at Muṣallá As-Ṣaḥāba will also be affected.

The prayer (iqāmah) times are the following unless otherwise advised:

Ṣalātul-Fajr: 20 minutes after the aḏān
Ṣalātudh-Dhuhr: 1:30pm
Ṣalātul-ʿAṣr: 20 minutes after the aḏān
Ṣalātul-Maġrib: 5 minutes after the aḏān
Ṣalātul-ʿishāʾ: 15 minutes after the aḏān

Ṣalātul-jumuʿah: 1:00pm
Due to limited space at the muṣallá, ṣalātul-jumu’ah will be for brothers only.

Jazākumullahu khair
