As-salaamu ‘alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakaatuh,

Due to the change in the daylight savings time (tomorrow morning), the prayer times at Musalla As-Sahaba will also be affected.

The prayer (iqaamah) times are the following unless otherwise advised:

Salaatul-Fajr: 20 minutes after the adhaan
Salaatudh-Dhuhr: 1:30pm
Salaatul-‘Asr: 20 minutes after the adhaan
Salaatul-Maghrib: 5 minutes after the adhaan
Salaatul-‘Ishaa: 15 minutes after the adhaan

Salaatul-Jumu’ah: 1:00pm
Due to limited space at the musalla, salaatul-jumu’ah will be for brothers only.

Jazakumullahu khair
