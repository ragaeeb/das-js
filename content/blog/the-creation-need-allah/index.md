Based upon an article by Imām Ibn al Qayyim al-Jawzīyah in his book, “Igathat ul-Lahfan min Massa’id Ash-Shayṭān” (The Relief of the Yearning [person] from the Traps of the Devil) Vol 1, PP 6-42.

Man always looks for what benefits him and what protects him from harm. However, to accomplish this, man must be able to realize what is harmful. He must then know whom he should need, trust, and love so that he can attain what is beneficial as well as to feel good about his choice. He also must know the proper and good approach that would make him achieve this goal. This latter condition requires that man:

Know about harm
What ways can be used to drive harm away
Certainly, man can have no better guidance than that which comes from the One Who had perfected everything, and the One who Has no deficiency in Himself and in His Attributes. The One Who is Ever-Living and Who does not die. There can be no One better than the One Who Has no need for anything; the One Who is rich; the Giver; the One who, after all, controls man’s soul. Man is so poor to Him. He is Allāh, the True and only God. Man can bring harm to himself if he seeks other than Allāh for help. Allāh is the One Who can help man drive away any harm for it cannot occur without His Will and His Power.

Allāh sent down His Books and chose His Messengers to guide man to:

Know His Lord as He had explained about Himself, and
Seek Him Alone while living in accordance with His plan
Knowing Allāh’s Names and Attributes liberates man from worshiping any form of creation because creation is weak and is in need of The Creator, Allāh. The knowledge about Allāh leads man to know that he is created to live according to Allāh’s way as revealed to the last Messenger Muḥammad (P). This Revelation contains a complete code of life. Everything that is beneficial or harmful is established so that man can center his life around this Revelation. If man commits wrong and knows that Allāh is Oft-Forgiving he would turn to Him and to Him alone seeking His forgiveness:

“Know, therefore, that there is no God Who deserves to be worshiped except Allāh; and ask forgiveness for your sins.” (Qurʾān, 47:19)

It is wrong to think or believe that Allāh created other ‘gods’ besides Him so that man turns to them for help; loves them or fear them, etc. He is the same God of all nations. He does not order that people should make of stars, sun, fire, Jesus, Moses, etc. gods besides Him. He (Most Exalted) cannot be ‘contradictory’. He has one way (religion) that calls man to surrender his will only to Him. He warned that if man (even Muḥammad (P) would take partners with Him, then his work will fail and will be among losers:

“And verily, it had been revealed to you (O Muḥammad) as has been revealed to those before you. If you join others in worship with Allāh (then) surely (all) your deeds will be in vain and you will certainly be among the losers. Nay! But worship Allāh and be among grateful.” (Qurʾān, 39:65-66)

Let us know what Muḥammad(P), the man-Prophet, who knew Allāh best, used to say:

“O Allāh, I seek refuge in You for Your Pleasure and against Your Wrath,and in Your Forgiveness and against Your Punishment and in You from You, I cannot Praise You as You can Praise Yourself. (Muslim, Abū Dawoud, al-Tirmiḏī, b. Mājah)

“I have surrendered myself to You, I have directed my face to You, I have entrusted my affairs to You, I have compelled my back to refuge in You, in want and in fright of You, there is no resort nor survival from You except (in turning) to You. I have faith in Your book (i.e. the Qurʾān) which You brought down and in the Prophet (Muḥammad) you have sent.” (Al-Bukhārī, Muslim)

When we read in the Qurʾān that:

“Whatever of Mercy (i.e. of good), Allāh may grant to mankind, none can withhold it, and whatever He may withhold, none can grant it thereafter. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.” (Qurʾān, 35:2)

And when we read that:

“If Allāh touches you with hurt, there is none can remove it but He; and if He intends any good for you, there is none who can repel His favor which He causes it to reach whomsoever of His slaves He will, and He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” (Qurʾān, 10:117)

We should be motivated to return to Him Alone at times of ease and at times of hardship.

And when we read that:

“If Allāh helps you none can overcome you, and if He forsakes you, who is there, after Him, that can help you. And in Allāh (alone) let believers put their trust.” (Qurʾān, 3:160)

The Qurʾān, therefore, leads man to a true liberation from any false attachment. It brings peace to the heart. It helps the believer against hypocrisy and all forms of dishonesty. Imagine, for example, a believer facing a problem at work. He sees wrong and faces unlawful practices. He does not fear rejecting what is wrong. He knows that the job is only a means to gain his sustenance. While he may be unable to correct what is wrong, he knows well that Allāh is the One Who provides. If he leaves his job for the sake of Allāh, Allāh will give him a better one. Allāh said:

“And whosoever fears Allāh and keeps his duty to Him. He will make a way for him to get out (from) every (difficulty), and He will provide him from (sources) he could never imagine.” (Qurʾān, 65:2-3)

The above texts, necessitates that man must depend upon Allāh asking Him Alone for assistance. It also requires that man must love Allāh and worship Him Alone to gain His pleasure and His help. Is it not true that the people who consider this life as the “Final Goal” end up worshiping many things in it? You see them so careful about “having it all”. They torture themselves: pain, difficulty, constant worry, keeping their hands in the banks for loan after loan to keep up with the “demands of development”. They are under the constant threat of fore-closure. They constantly see poverty in front of their eyes. The Prophet said:

“Allāh says: ‘Son of Ādam: Fill your time with My worship and I will fill your heart with richness, and end off your poverty. But if you do not, I would make your hands fully busy (i.e. in worldly affairs) and I would not end off your poverty.'” (At-Tirmiḏī said that it is a good ḥadīth)

Our purpose of existence on earth is more meaningful than being slaves to worldly gains. There can be no meaningful life better than that prescribed by our Creator Allāh. Every act done according to Allāh’s way is an act of worship. Man is the beneficiary and Allāh is in no need:

“O mankind! It is you who stand in need of Allāh, but Allāh is Rich (Free of all wants and needs), Worthy of All Praise.” (Qurʾān, 35:15)
