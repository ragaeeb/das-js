As salāmu ʿalaikum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

This is to inform you that there will be a telelink with Shaykh Muḥammad al-Māliki this Sunday, October 14th, at 2:00pm (after ṣalātudh-dhuhr which is at 1:30pm) at Muṣallá As-Ṣaḥāba (for brothers & sisters), with a 3-way call to Maktabah As-Ṣaḥāba (for sisters only), insha’Allāh. The telelink should hopefully begin at 2:00pm but please be prepared for any delays.

This telelink will deal with the explanation of the ḥadīth found in Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim relating to business transactions:

Ubida b. al-Simit (may Allāh be pleased with him) reported Allāh’s Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: Gold is to be paid for by gold, silver by silver, wheat by wheat, barley by barley, dates by dates, and salt by salt, like for like and equal for equal, payment being made hand to hand. If these classes differ, then sell as you wish if payment is made hand to hand. (Muslim, 1587)

Also that which will be covered are issues related to internet (online) transactions.

We hope that you can attend.

BarakAllāhu fīkum.
