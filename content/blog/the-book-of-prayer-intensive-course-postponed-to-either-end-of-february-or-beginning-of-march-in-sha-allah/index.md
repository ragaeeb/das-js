As-salāmu ʿalaykum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

Due to some complications, “The Book of Prayer” course being offered by Darul-Ḥadīth, will be postponed to either the end of February or beginning of March, in-shāʾ-Allāh. The organizers at Darul-Ḥadīth would like to sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. Hopefully this will give you some more time to prepare for the course, bi-idhnillahi taʿalá.

Bārak Allāhu fīkum

Dār As-Ṣaḥāba Admin on behalf of Darul-Ḥadīth.
