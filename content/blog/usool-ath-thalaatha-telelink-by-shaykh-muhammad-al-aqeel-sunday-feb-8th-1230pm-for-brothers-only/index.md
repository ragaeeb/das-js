As-salāmu ʿalaykum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

We apologize for the short notice, but tomorrow, Sunday, Feb. 8th at 12:30pm there will be a telelink at As-Ṣaḥāba Library with Shaykh Muḥammad al-ʿAqīl. He will be teaching ʾUṣūl ath-Thalātha which will be translated by our brother Abū ʿAbd al-Wāḥid Nadir Aḥmad.

Due to the circumstances and lack of proper facility because of the last minute notice, the class will be held at the front section (bookstore) of As-Ṣaḥāba Library as there will be a program going on for the sisters at the back of the library. Therefore, the lecture will be for brothers only. So, we ask the brothers who want to attend to please come in through the front door quietly and do not disturb anybody.

We will let you know if there will be anything in the future, in-shāʾ-Allāh.

Jazākumullahu khair
