As-salāmu ʿalaykum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

Perhaps some of you are aware that brother Abū Maryam from Libya is in Ottawa. For those who are interested, there will be a small sitting at Muṣallá As-Ṣaḥāba, Saturday night (July 4th) at 7:00pm until maġrib. This will be a general sitting for brothers only to meet and see him before he leaves with perhaps a small Q&A/general discussion. So if you are interested, then please feel free to come.

Bārak Allāhu fīkum
