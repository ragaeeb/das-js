assalaamu 'alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu,

InshaAllaah 'Eid will be held on Friday, October 26th at the Boys & Girls Club

(2825 Dumaurier Avenue)

PRAYER/KHUTBAH:

PLEASE LISTEN TO THE KHUTBAH AND REMAIN SILENT. For a number of years we've been having problems with people talking after the prayer during the 'Eid khutbah. Should you decide to stay while the khateeb is speaking, then you must show some respect for the Islamic knowledge, the khateeb and those who wish to listen to the khutbah by remaining silent. You may greet one another either outside of the prayer hall/area, or after the khutbah is completely finished. We also ask the sisters to be mindful about this and we ask the brothers who bring their families to please advise them in this.

Jazaakumullahu khairan wa baarakallahu feekum.
