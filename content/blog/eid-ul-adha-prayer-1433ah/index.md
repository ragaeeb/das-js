Assalāmu ʿalaykum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuhu,

InshaAllāh ʿīd will be held on Friday, October 26th at the Boys & Girls Club

(2825 Dumaurier Avenue)

PRAYER/KHUTBAH:

PLEASE LISTEN TO THE KHUṬBAH AND REMAIN SILENT. For a number of years we've been having problems with people talking after the prayer during the ʿīd Khuṭbah. Should you decide to stay while the khateeb is speaking, then you must show some respect for the Islāmic knowledge, the khateeb and those who wish to listen to the Khuṭbah by remaining silent. You may greet one another either outside of the prayer hall/area, or after the Khuṭbah is completely finished. We also ask the sisters to be mindful about this and we ask the brothers who bring their families to please advise them in this.

Jazākumullahu khairan wa bārakallahu fīkum.
