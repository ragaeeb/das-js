Just a short time ago, Fatwá-Online was informed of the official decision and announcement of the High Judiciary Council (HJC) of Saudi Arabia that we have completed thirty (30) days of Ḏū al-Qiʿdah, inshaa.-Allāh.

Subsequently, 1 Dhul-Ḥijjah 1429 will be today, Saturday 29 November 2008, and the Muslims performing Ḥajj will be in ʿArafah on Sunday 7 December 2008 (9 Ḏū al-Ḥijjah 1429), and the Muslim ummah shall be celebrating ʿĪd al-aḍḥá on Monday 8 December 2008, (10 Ḏū al-Ḥijjah 1429), inshā-Allāh.
