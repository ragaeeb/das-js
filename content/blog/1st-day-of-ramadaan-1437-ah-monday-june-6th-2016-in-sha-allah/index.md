As-salaamu 'alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakaatuh,

As the crescent of Ramadaan has been sighted, this is to inform you that the 1st day of Ramadaan will be Monday, June 6th, 2016, in-sha-Allah. This means that we will start praying salaatut-taraweeh tonight (the night of Sunday, June 5th, 2016, in-sha-Allah.

(Fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you, then complete thirty days of Sha'baan. And break your fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you then fast thirty days),

[transmitted by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim].

The following are the iqaamah times at Musalla As-Sahaba (2835 Dumaurier Ave., Ramsey area):

Al-Fajr Prayer – 4:05am (fixed)
Adh-Dhuhr Prayer – 1:30pm (fixed)
Al-‘Asr Prayer – 20 min. after the adhaan
Al-Maghrib Prayer – 10 min. after the adhaan
Al-‘Ishaa Prayer & At-Taraweeh Prayers – 10:30pm (fixed)

The iqaamah times will remain so unless further advised. Due to limited space, 'jumu'ah, 'ishaa and taraweeh prayers will be for brothers only.

Barakallahu feekum.
