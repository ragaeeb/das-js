As-salaamu 'alaikum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

As the crescent of Ramaḍān has been sighted, this is to inform you that the 1st day of Ramaḍān will be Monday, June 6th, 2016, in-sha-Allāh. This means that we will start praying ṣalātut-taraweeh tonight (the night of Sunday, June 5th, 2016, in-sha-Allāh.

(Fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you, then complete thirty days of Shaʿbān. And break your fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you then fast thirty days),

[transmitted by al-Bukhārī and Muslim].

The following are the iqaamah times at Muṣallá As-Ṣaḥāba (2835 Dumaurier Ave., Ramsey area):

Al-Fajr Prayer – 4:05am (fixed)
Adh-Dhuhr Prayer – 1:30pm (fixed)
Al-ʿAṣr Prayer – 20 min. after the aḏān
Al-Maġrib Prayer – 10 min. after the aḏān
Al-ʿishāʾ Prayer & At-Tarawīḥ Prayers – 10:30pm (fixed)
Al-jumuʿah Khuṭbah/Prayer – 1:00pm

The iqaamah times will remain so unless further advised. Due to limited space, 'jumu'ah, ʿishāʾ and taraweeh prayers will be for brothers only.

Barakallahu feekum.
