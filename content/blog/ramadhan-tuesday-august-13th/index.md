As-salāmu ʿalaikum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

This is to inform you that the 1st day of Ramaḍān is Tuesday, April 13, 2021, in-shāʾ-Allah.

Fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you, then complete thirty days of Shaʿbān. And break your fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you then fast thirty days.
[transmitted by al-Bukhārī and Muslim].

Also, this year due to COVID-19 Provincewide Shutdown measures [Emergency Brake and Stay-at-Home order](/closing-musalla-03-04-2021), there will NO ifṭār in the muṣallá.

Al-Tarawīḥ prayers will be available at As-Ṣaḥāba Muṣallá, however, will be limiting capacity to 15% occupancy of the room (with masks and social distancing measures). That means, a maximum of 15 people will be permitted in the Muṣallá for all prayers (the 5 daily prayers, al-jumuʿah prayers & al-Tarawīḥ prayers) on a first come first served basis for brothers only.

Al-ʿIshāʾ & at-Tarawīḥ Prayers Iqāmah Times

- Ramaḍān 1st - 14th (April 13th - 26th) = 9:30pm
- Ramaḍān 15th - 29/30th (April 27th - May 11/12th) = 10:00pm

The remaining prayer calendar/timings and iqāmah times at Muṣallá As-Ṣaḥāba (2835 Dumaurier Ave, Ramsey area) will be available shortly on our website. The iqāmah times will remain so unless further advised.

Al-Jumuʿah Prayers
First Khuṭbah: 1:00pm
Second Khuṭbah: 1:45pm
