By the esteemed Shaykh Muḥammad b. Ṣāliḥ al-ʿUthaymīn [1]

This right is the greatest right of any of the creation. None of the creation have a right greater than the rights of Allāh’s Messenger ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam. Allāh – the Most High – said:

“Indeed We have sent you as a witness rind a bringer of good-tidings and a warner, in order that mankind may believe in Allāh and His Messenger, and that you may assist and honour the Messenger.” [Sūrah al-Fatḥ 48:89]

Therefore it is obligatory to love the Prophet ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam over and above any of mankind – even above one’s love for himself, his parents and his children. The Prophet ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam said: “None of you will truly believes until he loves me more then his parents, his children and the whole of mankind.” [2]

And from the rights that ore due to the Prophet ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam are: that he should be honoured, loved and respected – but without any ġulū (exaggeration) or any falling short in the matter. Honouring the Prophet ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam during his lifetime implied honouring his Sunnah (guidance and example) and his noble character and conduct. As for honouring him after his death, then this implies honouring his Sunnah and the Sharīʿah (the Prescribed laws) that he was sent with. Whosoever reflects upon the lives of the Ṣaḥābah (Companions of the Prophet) will come to know how these great and virtuous people established the obligation of honouring the Messenger ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam.

‘Urwah b. Masʿūd said to the Quraysh: “O my people! I have seen kings. I have seen Caeser, Chouoes and Negus. But by Allāh! I have never seen a king whose companions respect and honor him in the way that the Companions of Muḥammad honour Muḥammad ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam. By Allāh! When he spits, the spittle would fall into the hands of one of them, who would then rub his face and skin with it; when he orders them with something, they promptly fulfill it; when he performs wuḍū’ (ablution), they vie with each other for the remains of the water; and when they speak in his presence, they lower their voices and do not look directly at his face, due to their respect and honour for him.” [3]

So this is how the Companions raḍiyallāhu ʿanhum loved and honoured him, for Allāh had endowed and blessed the Prophet ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam with a generous and noble character and a mild and easy-going nature. Had he been harsh and hard-hearted, people would not have been able to gather around him and be with him as they did.

Also from the rights that are due to the Prophet ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam is to believe in all that he informed as of with regards to the accounts of previous people and nations, to do that which he has commanded and leave that which he has prohibited, and to have īmān (faith) that his guidance and example is the best and most perfect guidance and example, and that the Sharīʿah (Prescribed Laws) that he was sent with is perfect and complete – no human laws nor systems are to be given precedence or priority over his Sharīʿah. Allāh – the Most High – said:

“But no by your Lord! They will not truly be Believers, until they make the Prophet ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam a judge in all their disputes, and then find in their souls no resistance against his decision, but rather accept it with the utmost submission.” [Sūrah an-Nisāʾ 4:65].

“Say: If you do love Allāh then follow the Prophet ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam. Allāh will then love you and forgive you your sins. Indeed Allāh is Oft-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.” [Sūrah Aal-‘lmrān 3:31].

And from the rights of the Prophet ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam is to defend his Sharīʿah and his guidance with the strength and capacity at one’s disposal, and also in proportion to the attack that it is under. Thus, if the enemies ore attacking it with false proofs and doubts, then his guidance and Sharīʿah should be defended with sound knowledge which refutes such false arguments and clarifies the doubts. If, however, the attack is made by any other types of weapons, then the defence should be made in a similar manner. It is not possible for any Believer to hear of some attack upon the Prophet ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam’s Sharīʿah or his noble personality, and then to keep silent about it- especially when one has the power to counter such on attack.
