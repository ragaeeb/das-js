As salāmu ʿalaikum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

This is to inform you that tomorrow night’s 40 aḥadīth class (Sunday, Nov. 23rd) is CANCELLED. Shaykh Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān will not be able to attend due to some personal responsibilities. Classes will resume next week, in-shā-Allāh, and we apologize for any inconvenience.

Please pass on this message. Bārak Allāhu fīkum.
