As-salāmu ʿalaykum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

As you are well aware, that Dār As-Ṣaḥāba will be holding a fundraiser BBQ this coming weekend (March 27th-29th) at As-Ṣaḥāba Library. Not only will it be a chance for people to help out financially, but also, it will be a chance to help out physically. So, in either way, you will have the opportunity to earn a lot of reward from Allāh (subḥānahu wa taʿalá).

Currently we are looking for volunteers to help serve, fundraise, clean, etc., both male (for Friday & Saturday) and female (for Sunday). For those brothers not taking “The Book of Prayer” course, we will really appreciate your help on Saturday between 3:30pm – 7:30pm. As of now, we have only a few people (brothers and sisters) to help out, so if you are interested, please reply to this email and express your desire and time to help. As mentioned before, the times for the event are as follows

Friday: 5pm – 10pm
Saturday: 2pm – 10pm
Sunday (Sisters Only): 1pm – 5pm

We will also need people before and after these times for set-up and clean-up, so you can also include 1 or 2 hours before and after the event.

Also, some of you may already know this, but we are looking for donations of Islāmic books or gently used muslim clothing (such as thawbs, khameez, Jilbābs, etc). We would like to collect these items between maġrib & ʿishāʾ on Thursday, in-shāʾ-Allāh. You may also bring food items (such as baked goods/side items) to be sold at the BBQ.

All proceeds will help support As-Ṣaḥāba Library.

Jazākumullahu khairan wa barakallahu fīkum.
