As salāmu ʿalaikum wa raḥmatullāhi wa barakātuh,

Shaykh Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān is starting a new class which will be held every Sunday, beginning this Sunday, Oct. 19th, between maġrib and ʿishāʾ prayers at Muṣallá as-Ṣaḥāba and telelinked to As-Ṣaḥāba Library. The class will be on Imām an-Nawawīʿs 40 Aḥadīth, and will include both the explanation as well as an opportunity for the memorization of the aḥadīth for both brothers and sisters.

Format of the Class:

Sisters’ time for revising the memorized ḥadīth – will be at Muṣallá as-Ṣaḥāba 1 hour before ṣalātul-maġrib every Sunday (on the same day). A sister will be present to check the reading of each sister. This is for sisters only!

Brothers’ time for revising the memorized ḥadīth – will be after ṣalātul-maġrib every Sunday (on the same day), in-sha’Allāh.

The Explanation of the ḥadīth – will also be after ṣalātul-maġrib every Sunday (on the same day) for both brothers and sisters.

This class is free for both brothers and sisters and we encourage you to benefit from this blessed knowledge and attend.

Please pass on this message.

Jazākam Allāhu khair.
