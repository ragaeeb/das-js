The Shaykh said in Sharḥ ʾuṣūlul-Īmān (pp.4-7):

[1] The dīn (religion) of Islām: It is the way of life that Allāh sent the Prophet Muḥammad ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam with. By it, Allāh terminated the validity of all other religions, perfected this religion for His worshippers, completed His favour upon them and has chosen only this religion for them – no other religion will be accepted by Him from anyone. Allāh – the Most High – said:

“Muḥammad is not the father of any man amongst you. Rather he is the Messenger of Allāh and the khaatim (last and final) of the Prophets.” [Sūrah al-Aḥzāb 33:40].

“This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islām as your religion.” [Sūrah al-Māʿidah 5:3].

“Indeed the religion with Allāh is Islām.” [Sūrah Aal-ʿImrān 3:19].

“Whosoever seeks a religion other than Islām, never will it be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.” [Sūrah Aal-ʿImrān 3:85].

And Allāh – the Most High – obligated all of mankind to take Islām as their religion. So Allāh said, whilst addressing His Messenger ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam:

“Say: O Mankind! Indeed I have been sent to you all as the Messenger of Allāh; to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. None has the right to be worshipped except Him; it is He who gives life and cause death. So believe in Allāh and His Messenger – the Prophet who can neither read nor write – who believes in Allāh and His Words. So follow the Messenger of Allāh so that you may be rightly-guided.” [Sūrah al-Aʿrāf 7:158].

And in Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim (1/93), from Abū Hurayrah radi Allāhu ‘anhu that Allāh’s Messenger ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam said:

“By Him in whose Hand is the life of Muḥammad! There is no one from this nation, be he a Jew or a Christian, who hears of me and dies whilst not having īmān (faith) in what I have been sent with, except that he will be one of the companions of the Hellfire.”

And īmān (faith) in the Prophet implies: affirming that which he was sent with, along with acceptance of it and submission to it. Without these two matters, mere affirmation is not sufficient. This is why even though Abū Ṭālib (the Prophet’s uncle) affirmed what was sent to the Prophet ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam and that Islām was the best of religions, yet he did not accept his message nor submit to it; and thus he did not have īmān in the Prophet ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam.

[2] The religion of Islām contains all that was beneficial from the previous religions. It is suitable for implementation in any age, anywhere and by any nation. Allāh – the Most High – said, whilst addressing His Messenger ṣallallāhu ‘alayhi wa sallam:

“And We have sent down to you the Book in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it, testifying to the truth contained therein whilst exposing the falsehood that has been added therein.” [Sūrah al-Māʿidah 5:48].

That Islām is suitable for implementation in any age, any where and by any nation does not mean that it becomes submissive to nations – being altered and changed by them – as some people falsely think. But rather it means that whenever it is truly adhered to then it brings benefit and goodness to that nation, as well as reforming and correcting it – in whatever age or place.

[3] The religion of Islām is the religion of truth. It is the way of life that Allāh – the Most High – guaranteed His help and victory to those who truly adhere to it, and that He would make it dominant over all other religions. Allāh – the Most High – said:

“It is He who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, that it may prevail over all other religions, even if the pagans detest it.” [Sūrah at-Tawbah 9:33].

And Allāh – the Most High – said:

“Allāh has promised to those amongst you who truly have īmān (true faith and belief) and act in obedience to Allāh and His Messenger, that He will grant them ruler ship upon the earth, just as He granted it to those before them, and that He will establish their Religion for them and grant them the authority to practice their Religion which He chose and ordered them with. And He will certainly change their situation to one of security, after their fear. Providing that they worship and obey Me, not associating anything else in worship with Me. Then, whoever rejects this favour by disobedience to their Lord – then they are the rebellious transgressors.” [Sūrah an-Nūr 24:55].

[4] The religion of Islām is a complete religion comprising both ʿaqīdah (beliefs) and sharīʿah (laws).

It commands them with tawḥīd (to single out Allāh alone for worship) and prohibits them from shirk (associating partners with Allāh, in that which is particular to Him).
It commands them with being truthful and prohibits them from lying.
It commands them with ʿadl (justice) and prohibits them from injustice and oppression.
It commands them with fulfilling trusts and prohibits them from acting treacherously.
It commands them keeping promises and prohibits them from breaking them.
It commands them with kindness and good treatment of parents and prohibits them from disobedience to them in that which is not sinful.
It commands them with joining the ties of relations and prohibits them from severing them.
It commands them with good treatment of neighbours and prohibits the causing of harm to them.
In short, Islām orders alls that is good, from manners and morals, and prohibits all that is evil from it. Likewise, it orders all actions which are righteous and good and prohibits all actions that are evil and harmful. Allāh – the Most High – said:

“Indeed Allāh enjoins upon you justice, kindness and the giving of good to relatives and near ones. And He prohibits you from all shameful and evil deeds, oppression and transgression. Thus He admonishes you, that you may take heed and be reminded.” [Sūrah an-Naḥl 16:90].
