## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get your IslƒÅmic centre up and running from scratch bootstrapped with `Islamic Simplefolio`.

### Domain name registration

Go to a domain name registration platform and register a domain name. In this example we will use [namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com) and purchase a domain name for your masjid. In this example we will assume we have registered [dar-as-sahaba.com](https://dar-as-sahaba.com). Note that you do not need any of add-ons like SSL, or anything else. However for privacy reasons I suggest you add in the `Free Whoisguard` add-on.

### Cloudflare

<img src="https://github.com/ragaeeb/das-js/blob/master/examples/cloudflare_dns.jpg" alt="Nameserver settings on Cloudflare" />

`Cloudflare` provides websites a set of free services such as `DDOS` protection and other speed optimizations that will be useful. We will be changing our name servers to Cloudflare to let it route our traffic.

1. Go to [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com), create an account, and then `Add a Site`.
2. Choose the `FREE` option.
3. Add the domain-name you have just registered (ie: [dar-as-sahaba.com](https://dar-as-sahaba.com))
4. Once it asks you to validate all the DNS information, simply continue.
5. Once everything is complete, `Cloudflare` will give you some name servers you need to replace your existing ones on `Namecheap` with.
6. Open another tab on your browser and go back to Namecheap, and click on `Manage` to edit your domain name settings.
7. Under your domain, in the `Domain` tab, you will see a `NAMESERVERS` section, from the dropdown use `Custom DNS`.
8. In the two fields, set the two `something.ns.cloudflare.com` addresses that `Cloudflare` gave you.
9. Save the settings.
10. Go back on `Cloudflare` and click the `Recheck Nameservers` button.

<img src="https://github.com/ragaeeb/das-js/blob/master/examples/namecheap_dns.jpg" alt="Nameserver Settings on Namecheap" />

At this point this may take some time (ie: usually an hour or so) to change the nameservers over.

<img src="https://github.com/ragaeeb/das-js/blob/master/examples/cloudflare_success.jpg" alt="Cloudflare success message" />

### Technical Part (Cloning & Configuration)

This is the slightly technical part. But you won't have to download any tools, but you will have to create a few accounts to get everything to work properly.

#### Placeholders

Go to `/src/mock/data.js` and fill your information that are specific for your centre:

##### Hero Section

This section modifies what appears at the very top of the page such as prayer timings, and hijri dates and links.

###### Calculation Parameters

These are configured using `12` degrees for the Fajr and  øIshƒÅ æ twilight angles (ie: Nautical Twilight) for the most accurate version of calculating the `Fajr` time instead of using the other conventions. Note that using other conventions that your region and other masƒÅjid in your area may be using may not result in the most accurate time which is vitally important because it may during the month of Rama·∏çƒÅn eating Su·∏•≈´r later than the allowed time, or praying Fajr before its actual entrance! [Read more about this here](https://ia802902.us.archive.org/32/items/fajr-letter-das/Letter_Fajr-Ishaa_Ottawa-2016-06-27.pdf). Change these at your own discretion.

<img src="https://github.com/ragaeeb/das-js/blob/master/examples/geo.jpg" alt="Getting latitude and longitude for an address" />

The only values you should need to modify here are `latitude`, `longitude` and replace those numbers with the exact geographical coordinates for [your IslƒÅmic centre](https://www.latlong.net/convert-address-to-lat-long.html). You will also need to replace the `timeZone` which you can find [here](http://www.timezoneconverter.com/cgi-bin/findzone).

<img src="https://github.com/ragaeeb/das-js/blob/master/examples/timezone.png" alt="Getting a timezone for your location" />

```javascript
export const heroData = {
  calculation: {
    fajrAngle: 12,
    ishaAngle: 12,
    latitude: '45.3506',
    longitude: '-75.793',
    method: 'NauticalTwilight',
    timeZone: 'America/Toronto',
  },
  ‚Ä¶
```

###### Labels

If you want to customize the labels of each of the prayer times and events you can do so here.

```javascript
  ‚Ä¶
  labels: {
    fajr: 'Fajr',
    sunrise: 'Sunrise',
    dhuhr: 'Dhuhr',
    asr: ' øA·π£r',
    maghrib: 'Maƒ°rib',
    isha: ' øIshƒÅ æ',
    middleOfTheNight: '1/2 Night Begins',
    lastThirdOfTheNight: 'Last 1/3 Night Begins',
    jumuah: 'Khu·π≠bah al-Jumu øah',
  },
  ‚Ä¶
```

###### IqƒÅmah Schedule

Some masƒÅjid have some variable timings for the different prayers that do not remain upon a fixed schedule throughout the year. As a result this section is a bit more complex, to allow some more customization.

For each of the events (ie: `fajr`, `dhuhr`, `jumuah`, etc.) you can customize exactly when the IqƒÅmah for that prayer is made in one of three ways.

###### Fixed IqƒÅmah Timings

If your timings for a prayer will always be a fixed pattern, you can just include them in text like this:

```javascript
  ‚Ä¶
  iqamahs: {
    ‚Ä¶
    fajr: '+20 mins',
    dhuhr: '+5 mins',
    ‚Ä¶
  ‚Ä¶
```

This means that no matter what time of the year, the iqƒÅmah for Fajr will always be `20 minutes` after the a·∏èƒÅn and the iqƒÅmah for Dhuhr will always be `5 minutes` after the a·∏èƒÅn. You can replace it with any text there and it will show up, it does not have to follow the `+X minutes` pattern, although this is a good convention to use to remain consistent.

###### Multiple IqƒÅmahs

<img src="https://github.com/ragaeeb/das-js/blob/master/examples/iqamahs.jpg" alt="Setting multiple iqƒÅmah times" />

If you have more than one congregational prayer (ie: you hold a second jamƒÅ øah), you can enter it in a list like this:

```javascript
  ‚Ä¶
  iqamahs: {
    ‚Ä¶
    fajr: ['4:00 AM', '4:35 AM'],
    dhuhr: ['+5 mins', '+30 mins'],
    ‚Ä¶
  ‚Ä¶
```

###### Variable IqƒÅmahs

If you have very specific timings that vary throughout the year, you will have to be a bit more detailed. For the specific prayer that you need variable iqƒÅmah timings for, you will have to list out all the months (ie: 1-12 with `1` for `January`, and `12` for `December`), and then provide the ranges for each.

The following example shows a masjid for which in `January` the Dhuhr prayer iqƒÅmah will be at `12:30 PM`, then in `February`, they will hold two congregational prayers, one at `12:30 PM`, and one at `1:00 PM`.

From `March 1st` (until `March 7th` inclusive), the iqƒÅmah will be at `12:30 PM`, then starting `March 8th` (until `March 20th` inclusive) the iqƒÅmah will be at `1:30 PM`. Finally starting on `March 21st` until the end of the month, there will be two congregational prayers, one at `1:30 PM` and the other at `1:45 PM`.

Then for the rest of the year, the Dhuhr iqƒÅmah will be fixed to `1:30 PM`.

You can add as many ranges as you want.

```javascript
  ‚Ä¶
  iqamahs: {
    ‚Ä¶
    dhuhr: {
      1: '12:30 PM',
      2: ['12:30 PM', '1:00 PM'],
      3: {
        1: '12:30 PM',
        8: '1:30 PM',
        21: ['1:30 PM', '1:45 PM'],
      },
      4: '1:30 PM',
      5: '1:30 PM',
      6: '1:30 PM',
      7: '1:30 PM',
      8: '1:30 PM',
      9: '1:30 PM',
      10: '1:30 PM',
      11: '12:30 PM',
      12: '12:30 PM',
    },
    ‚Ä¶
  ‚Ä¶
```

###### Adjusting Hijri Date

Sometimes throughout the year the calculated Hijri date can differ from the IslƒÅmic date due to moonsightings which are supposed to take precedence over the calculated date. This is especially important in months such as `Rama·∏çƒÅn` where your centre may be following the moonsighting of the locality to determine the Islamic date. During those times you may need to adjust the calculation by modifying the `hijriAdjust` value. `-1` means show the Hijri date to be `1 day before` the calculated one, `-2` means `2 days before`, `0` means leave it exactly as calculated, `1` means show the Hijri date to be `1 day after` the calculated one, `2` means it should be `2 days` after the calculated one, etc.

```javascript
  ‚Ä¶
export const heroData = {
  ‚Ä¶
  hijriAdjust: -1,
  ‚Ä¶
```

###### Links

Sometimes you may need some additional details you want to provide to your audience regarding specific prayers. For example if your `Fajr` prayer timing differs from the other masƒÅjid in your locality, you may want to explain why. You can do this by adding the specific prayer you want to add this link for with the URL you want to link that prayer to.

<img src="https://github.com/ragaeeb/das-js/blob/master/examples/fajr_link.jpg" alt="Attaching a link to Fajr timing" />

The following example shows both the Fajr and Dhuhr prayer labels that will be rendered as clickable links.

```javascript
  ‚Ä¶
export const heroData = {
  ‚Ä¶
  links: {
    fajr: 'https://archive.org/download/fajr-letter-das/Letter_Fajr-Ishaa_Ottawa-2016-06-27.pdf',
    dhuhr: 'https://anotherlink.pdf',
  },
  ‚Ä¶
```

###### Calendar Link

<img src="https://github.com/ragaeeb/das-js/blob/master/examples/calendar.jpg" alt="Google Calendar link" />

Instead of duplicating your events information on the website, it is optimal for you to create your events on `Google Calendar` and then link to it on the website so your audience can see the most up to date information about it.

```javascript
  ‚Ä¶
export const heroData = {
  ‚Ä¶
  calendarUrl: 'https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=60me58mrktt0lt24mijjkhddvc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York',
  ‚Ä¶
```

If you don't want to include a calendar link, simply remove the `calendarUrl` entry from `data.js`.

<img src="https://github.com/ragaeeb/das-js/blob/master/examples/calendar_share.jpg" alt="Making a Google Calendar public" />

To create a calendar for your IslƒÅmic centre:

1. Go to [https://calendar.google.com](https://calendar.google.com).
2. On the left-side, under `Other Calendars`, click `Create New Calendar`.
3. Give it a name, description and set the timezone.
4. Click `Create Calendar`.
5. On the left side click on your newly created Calendar.
6. Under `Calendar Settings` scroll down to `Access Permissions`.
7. Check the `Make available to public` and ensure `See all event details` is selected.
8. Scroll down to `Integrate Calendar`, and copy the `Public URL to the calendar` value.
9. This is the URL we will use in the `calendarUrl` to allow your audience to access your centre's events.

<img src="https://github.com/ragaeeb/das-js/blob/master/examples/calendar_url.jpg" alt="Getting the Calendar URL" />

###### SƒÅ æ al-IstijƒÅbah

<img src="https://github.com/ragaeeb/das-js/blob/master/examples/istijaba.jpg" alt="Last Hour on Friday" />

You can display a reminder for all those who visit your website at the time when du øƒÅ æ is accepted in the last hour of Friday. You can show them a hadith or some custom text in the `istijabaText` field. If you do not want to display anything, then remove that.

```javascript
  ‚Ä¶
export const heroData = {
  ‚Ä¶
  istijabaText: 'The text you want to show',
  ‚Ä¶
```

##### About Section

<img src="https://github.com/ragaeeb/das-js/blob/master/examples/about.jpg" alt="About Us Section" />

This is the information that will be displayed right underneath the updates. You can add as many services as you want by copying and pasting the `title`, and `body` patterns.

```javascript
export const aboutData = {
  paragraphOne: 'First paragraph',
  paragraphTwo: 'Second paragraph',
  services: [
    {
      title: 'Five Daily ·π¢alawƒÅt',
      body:
        'The mu·π£all√° is open to allow Muslims (both brothers and sisters) a location to pray their five daily ·π£alawƒÅt.',
    },
    {
      title: '·π¢alat al-Jum øuah',
      body:
        'Every week, salat-ul-Jum øuah is held (due to limited space, for brothers only), where the kha·π≠ƒ´b deliver the khu·π≠bah strictly adhering to the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn & the Sunnah.',
    },
  ],
};
```

##### Donate Section

<img src="https://github.com/ragaeeb/das-js/blob/master/examples/donate.jpg" alt="Donate Section" />

You can set all the ways your audience can donate to your IslƒÅmic centre here.

For the `PayPal` you can either use a `paypal.me` link, or use a [payment button link](https://www.paypal.com/buttons/).

The `etransfer` email address will automatically be scrambled so that spam bots do not pick it up, but it should show up fine for the users.

In the `expenses` field, you can list out the individual expenses for your IslƒÅmic centre that your audience will be donating to support. The app will automatically add the values up to create a total, and build a pie chart breaking down each expense.

You can remove any of the fields if you do not want to show them.

```javascript
export const donationsData = {
  directDeposit: 'Direct deposit information',
  etransfer: 'youremailaddress@gmail.com',
  expenses: [
    { label: 'Rent', value: 1000 },
    { label: 'Utilities', value: 600 },
  ],
  khutbah: 'After the Friday sermon, donations for the mu·π£all√° are collected.',
  paypal: 'https://paypal.me/yourbrand',
  reminderDawah: 'Reminder text here',
  reminderReward: 'Another reminder about ·π£adaqah',
};
```

##### Footer Section

<img src="https://github.com/ragaeeb/das-js/blob/master/examples/footer.png" alt="Footer Section" />

Set your center's social media information here. You can set platforms such as [twitter](https://twitter.com), [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com), [instagram](https://instagram.com), [facebook](https://facebook.com), [telegram](https://t.me), and [youtube](https://youtube.com).

Set the `effectiveDate` to the date your website launched live to enforce the `Privacy Policy` for your users.

```javascript
export const footerData = {
  networks: [
    {
      name: 'twitter',
      url: 'https://twitter.com/DarAsSahaba',
    },
  ],
  privacyPolicy: {
    effectiveDate: '18 July 2020',
  },
};
```

##### Contact Section

<img src="https://github.com/ragaeeb/das-js/blob/master/examples/contact.jpg" alt="Contact Section" />

Set your centre's contact information here. The email address will automatically be scrambled to be protected from spam bots but should be visible to the user.

If you do not want to display a specific attribute, simply omit it.

```javascript
export const contactInfo = {
  address: 'Your masjid address',
  cta: 'Some information here about when they can come see your centre.',
  emailButton: 'Email Us',
  mailingList: 'Mailing List',
  email: 'yourmeail@gmail.com',
  mapUrl: 'https://goo.gl/maps/14LYnHa7R9sZsQBG7',
  telButton: 'Call Us',
  tel: '+12345678',
};
```

#### STYLES

Change the color theme of the website ( choose 2 colors to create a gradient ):

Go to `src/styles/abstracts/_variables.scss` and only change the values on these classes `$main-color` and `$secondary-color` to your prefered HEX color

```scss
// Default values

## Development

### Adding static images

If we ever want to import an image directly which Gatsby can process we can do it like this:

Let's say we wanted to include image from 'src/images/das_bg.jpg', we can do:

```

import dasBg from '../images/das_bg.jpg';

```

And then in the `render()`

```
<img src={dasBg} />
```
